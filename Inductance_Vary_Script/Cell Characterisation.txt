DSFQ AND Cell with Rylov's DSFQ Loop with Dual Time Constants Characterisation Information


/* Characteristics */

Designed Skew Tolerance: 10ps
True Skew Tolerance: 12ps
Cell Propagation Time - The time bewteen which the inputs are 4.44 RAD (0.707 * 2pi) and the output is 4.44 RAD
Cell Propagation Time: ~0.5ps.
Mininum Time between sucessive 0 skew inputs: 8ps
Reccomended Time Between Inputs: 25ps - this includes a little bit of tolerance for skew on the second set of inputs.

/* Margins */
Critical Margin: 21.5% for a Skew Tolerance of 10ps
Critical  Component (bd1 +)

True Skew Time: 14ps - the time at which the gate no longer functions correctly.

Margin Analysis Performed at 10ps.
The gate is optimized for a skew tolerance of 11ps but allows an extereme tolerance of 14ps.
It was only optimized for 11ps.

10ps - 21.5%
11ps - 21.5%
12ps - 14.2%
13ps - 5.9%
14ps - 0.1%
