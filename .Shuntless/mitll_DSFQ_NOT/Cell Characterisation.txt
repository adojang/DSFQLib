DSFQ NOT Cell with Schindler's RSFQ NOT cell


/* Characteristics */

This gate requires the inverted signal, A to arrive before the CLK signal. A JTL is included in the DSFQ OR's 'CLK' output to give a small margin for skew tolerance.
If the user requires greater skew tolerance, the OR gate's inputs (B and C) should be delayed using JTL's.

Designed Skew Tolerance between A and CLK: 1ps

Cell Propagation Time - The time bewteen which the inputs are 4.44 RAD (0.707 * 2pi) and the output is 4.44 RAD
Average Cell Propagation Time: ~7.7ps

Mininum Time between sucessive CLK skew inputs: 9ps (Limited by DSFQ OR Gate)
This minimum time is for purely CLK inputs with A being zero.

Reccomended Time Between Inputs: 10ps

/* Margins */

The Margins of this gate will be the lowest margin of the DSFQ OR or RSFQ NOT gate.
