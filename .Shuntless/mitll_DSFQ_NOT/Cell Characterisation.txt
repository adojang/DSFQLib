DSFQ NOT Cell with Schindler's RSFQ NOT cell


/* Characteristics */

This gate requires the inverted signal, A to arrive before the CLK signal. A JTL is included in the DSFQ OR's 'CLK' output to give a small margin for skew tolerance.
If the user requires greater skew tolerance, the OR gate's inputs (B and C) should be delayed using JTL's.


Cell Propagation Time - The time bewteen which the inputs are 4.44 RAD (0.707 * 2pi) and the output is 4.44 RAD
Average Cell Propagation Time: ~9.1ps (Single and Double OR input)

The RSFQ NOT cell captures the input of A, and similar to a DFF, this value is only released when there is a CLK signal.
Thus, the time between signal A and signal CLK can be 50ps and larger, as long as the CLK signal arrives after A.



Minimum time between sucessive inputs: 8ps
Reccomended Time Between Sucessive Inputs: 10ps or greater (Limited by the DSFQ OR Gate)


/* Margins */

The Margins of this gate will be the lowest margin of the DSFQ OR or RSFQ NOT gate.
But this is not the case.

By explicitly defining each cell and removing all subckt's, the default margin is 13.1%, which is based on ib3-, a component in Schindler's NOT gate.
By optimizing the gate slightly, we get a better margin. if Ib3 is changed from it's default of 2.5700e-04 to 2.8500e-04 the margin increases to an acceptable 21.7%, still on ib3-.

Operating at 15ps, this is
