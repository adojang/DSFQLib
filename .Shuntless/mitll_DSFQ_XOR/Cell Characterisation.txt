DSFQ MUX Cell with Rylov's DSFQ Loop, DSFQ AND, DSFQ OR, and DSFQ NOT cells which uses Schindlers NOT gate


/* Characteristics */



Skew Tolerance Between Inputs:


Cell Propagation Time - The time bewteen which the inputs are 4.44 RAD (0.707 * 2pi) and the output is 4.44 RAD
Average Propagation Time: ~22.27ps
Mininum Time between sucessive skew inputs: 8ps
Reccomended Time Between Inputs: 10ps - this is what the gate was optimized for.

/* Margins */




/* Margin Test Parameters */

Test Inputs:
* A   0 0 1 1
* NA  - 1 1 0
* B   0 1 0 1
* Q   0 1 1 0
