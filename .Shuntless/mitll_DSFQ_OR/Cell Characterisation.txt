DSFQ OR Cell with Rylov's DSFQ Loop with Dual Time Constants Characterisation Information


/* Garbage */

Min time between sucessive is 6ps.

Anything after that will trigger the cell twice.





/* Characteristics */

Designed Skew Tolerance: xxx
True Skew Tolerance: xxx
Cell Propagation Time - The time bewteen which the inputs are 4.44 RAD (0.707 * 2pi) and the output is 4.44 RAD
Cell Propagation Time: xxx
Mininum Time between sucessive 0 skew inputs: 24ps xxxxxxxxxx
Reccomended Time Between Inputs: 25ps - this includes a little bit of tolerance for skew on the second set of inputs.

/* Margins */

Critical Margin: 25.8% xx
Critical  Component (B1 -) xx
Margin of 2ps: 25.8% (B1 -) xx 
Margin of 1ps: 14.9% (B1 -)xx 
Margin of 0ps: 5.50% (B1 -)xx

A Margin of 2ps means that we design for a margin of 10ps, but the true skew tolerance limit is 12ps. xx
