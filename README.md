# DSFQLib
This library aims to offer a standard DSFQ library of cells for use in superconductor logic systems.

A Pipeline architecture is developed and also demonstrated where the advantages that DSFQ offer can be fully exploited.

The included symbol library includes a new proposed Josephson Junction symbol that will differentiate it from the symbol currently being used - which is also being used by a sparkgap. This wasn't a problem 20 years ago, but because of the increasing prevelence of multi-disciplinary projects, this is an attempt to avoid needless confusion and misunderstanding.

For questions about the library, contact Adriaan van Wijk, 21786275@sun.ac.za
